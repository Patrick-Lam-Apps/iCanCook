                    <b>Using our Services</b><br>

                    You must follow any policies made available to you within the Services.
                    Don’t misuse our Services. For example, don’t interfere with our Services or try to
                    access them using a method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide.
                    You may use our Services only as permitted by law, including applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations.
                    We may suspend or stop providing our Services to you if you do not comply with our terms or policies or if we are investigating suspected misconduct.
                    Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content you access.
                    You may not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted by law. These terms do not
                    grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in our Services. Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Services.

                    <br><br>
                    <b>Your  Account </b> <br>
                    You may need a ICanCook Account in order to use some of our Services.
                    To protect your ICanCook Account, keep your password confidential.
                    You are responsible for the activity that happens on or through your Google Account.

                    <b>Your Content, Out Service</b><br>
                    Some of our Services allow you to upload, submit, store, send or receive content.
                    You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours.

                    When you upload, submit, store, send or receive content to or through our Services, you give Google (and those we work with) a worldwide license to use,
                    host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works

                    communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such content. The rights you grant in this license are for the limited purpose of operating,
                    promoting, and improving our Services, and to develop new ones. This license continues even if you stop using our Services.
                    Some Services may offer you ways to access and remove content that has been provided to that Service. Also, in some of our Services, there are
                    terms or settings that narrow the scope of our use of the content submitted in those Services. Make sure you have the necessary rights to grant
                    us this license for any content that you submit to our Services.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>These Terms and You</b><br>
                    We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services.
                    You should look at the terms regularly. We’ll post notice of modifications to these terms on this page. We’ll post notice of modified additional terms in
                    the applicable Service. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted. However, changes
                    addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service,
                    you should discontinue your use of that Service.
                    If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the additional terms will control for that conflict.
                    These terms control the relationship between ICanCook and you.

                    <b>What is ICanCook?</b> <br>
                    Our web application creates a platform for the community to post and share healthy cooking recipes with a free and easy to access vast recipe list. Our main focus is to carry out a reverse search and start cooking with the ingredients u have rather than making frequent stops to the store. This does not only save time, but also money. We all are students and know how difficult it can be to start cooking. Thus, we will experiment this site and make it open to students - to reduce the consumption of unhealthy food , before launching it to the general public

                    <b>Who are we?</b><br>
                    We are a group of students in CMPT 470 Group-13 Fall 2016.
